TODO
In this app, you'll need to load songs from a json-server when a button in the Navbar is clicked and then use state and events to build a lot of other core functionality. 

Lastly, you will have to change code that you are not told explicitly to. Decide based on the feature/deliverable what code needs to be written or changed and then go do it! Play around with the code and test often. 

Look out for `TODO`s in comments. Use the Core Deliverables listed below to guide you and find the `TODO`s if you're feeling stuck.

## Skills and Concepts to Practice
- TODO

## Setup
After cloning down the project:
- Run `git checkout -b yourname` in your terminal to create your own branch
- Run `npm install` in your terminal
- Run `npm start` and a JSON server will spin up a mock back-end API and you can access the data at `http://localhost:6001/channels`. Your react application will also start, on port `6002`. The response should contain an array of objects that are structured as follows:
```
[{
"id": 1,
"name": "Tiger Lovers Unite",
"starred": false
},
{
"id": 2,
"name": "Flatiron Sayings",
"starred": true
},
{
"id": 3,
"name": "Absolute Nonsense",
"starred": true
}]
```
- Remember to `git add .` then `git commit -m "helpful message"` and `git push` when you're done or before lecture.

### Additional Files
- `db.json` stores the data for our json-server. Check it out to make sure you know the format of the data.
